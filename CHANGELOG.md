## Known Limitations

- Single delivery address per order (address book planned for v0.3.0)
- No search autocomplete or suggestions (planned for v0.2.0)
- No social login options (email/password only) (planned for v0.2.0)
- JWT sessions cannot be instantly revoked (considering database sessions in v0.5.0)

---

## Security

- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Email verification required for account activation
- HTTP-only cookies for session tokens
- CSRF protection via NextAuth
- Input validation and sanitization on all endpoints
- SQL injection prevention via Prisma parameterized queries
- Environment variable protection for sensitive data
- Soft delete for data retention and recovery

---

## Performance Considerations

- Image optimization via Next.js Image component
- Lazy loading for marketplace products

- Skeleton loading states for perceived performance
